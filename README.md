# Git Session for Utah Library Association Conference, 2019

The University of Utah Marriott Library is using git and github for documenting and tracking code and collaborating on projects, creating group research repositories with version control, developing best practices documentation, and more. This overview will provide case studies illustrating how git and github has become an essential tool in the project managerâ€™s toolbox. Also included in the session will be a guide for learning git on your own. 

Included in this repository are the slides for our presentation, along with some git learning resources.
